<h3>Lectures</h3>

In 2024-5, I've been teaching Mathematical Finance.

If you’re thinking about taking Mathematical Finance, you might find it helpful to look through this document on “<a href="https://maths.dur.ac.uk/users/clare.wallace/MF/Prerequisites/">prerequisite knowledge</a>” for the course that I give out in the first weeks of term.

For 2025-6, I'll be teaching Probability 1 and Single Maths B.

<h3>Office hours </h3>

This year I’m offering two final-year projects. You can find the project descriptions <a href="https://cwallace23.github.io/teaching/final-year-projects">here</a>.

My office hours this term are Fridays from 2 until 3pm. You can reach me by email at any time, or come to MCS3060 with questions.

I’m still working on my teaching philosophy, but Federico Ardila’s <a href="http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/">axioms for diversity</a>, Francis Su’s thoughts on <a href="https://www.francissu.com/post/the-lesson-of-grace-in-teaching">grace in teaching</a>, and Eugenia Cheng’s manifesto on <a href="http://eugeniacheng.com/inclusivity/">inclusivity</a>, as well as her book <a href="http://eugeniacheng.com/math/books/">x+y</a>, are a really good place to start.

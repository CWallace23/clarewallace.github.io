### Lectures

In 2024-5, I've been teaching Mathematical Finance.

If you’re thinking about taking Mathematical Finance, you might find it helpful to look through this document on "[prerequisite knowledge](https://maths.dur.ac.uk/users/clare.wallace/MF/Prerequisites/)" for the course that I give out in the first weeks of term.

For 2025-6, I'll be teaching Probability 1 and Single Maths B.

### Office hours 

This year I’m offering two final-year projects. You can find the project descriptions [here](https://cwallace23.github.io/teaching/final-year-projects).

My office hours this term are Fridays from 2 until 3pm. You can reach me by email at any time, or come to MCS3060 with questions.

I’m still working on my teaching philosophy, but Federico Ardila’s [axioms for diversity](http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/), Francis Su’s thoughts on [grace in teaching](https://www.francissu.com/post/the-lesson-of-grace-in-teaching), and Eugenia Cheng’s manifesto on [inclusivity](http://eugeniacheng.com/inclusivity/), as well as her book [x+y](http://eugeniacheng.com/math/books/), are a really good place to start.

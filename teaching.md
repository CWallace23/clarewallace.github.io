Currently I teach Mathematical Finance.

If you’re thinking about taking Mathematical Finance, you might find it helpful to look through this document on “prerequisite knowledge” for the course that I give out in the first weeks of term.

This year I’m offering two final-year projects. You can find the project descriptions here.

My office hours this term are Fridays from 2 until 3pm. You can reach me by email at any time, or come to MCS3060 with questions.

I’m still working on my teaching philosophy, but Federico Ardila’s axioms for diversity, Francis Su’s thoughts on grace in teaching, and Eugenia Cheng’s manifesto on inclusivity, as well as her book x+y, are a really good place to start.

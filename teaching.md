### The important stuff

This year I’m offering two final-year projects. You can find the project descriptions [here](https://cwallace23.github.io/teaching/final-year-projects).


My office hours this term are Fridays from 2 until 3pm. You can reach me by email at any time, or come to MCS3060 with questions.

### ?

I’m still working on my teaching philosophy, but Federico Ardila’s [axioms for diversity](http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/), Francis Su’s thoughts on [grace in teaching](https://www.francissu.com/post/the-lesson-of-grace-in-teaching), and Eugenia Cheng’s manifesto on [inclusivity](http://eugeniacheng.com/inclusivity/), as well as her book [x+y](http://eugeniacheng.com/math/books/), are a really good place to start.


### Lectures

#### Mathematical Finance

I've taught the Michaelmas term of Math Finance in 2022-23, 2023-24, and 2024-25.

If you’re thinking about taking Mathematical Finance, you might find it helpful to look through this document on "[prerequisite knowledge](https://maths.dur.ac.uk/users/clare.wallace/MF/Prerequisites/)" for the course that I give out in the first weeks of term.

#### Single Maths B

I taught the Probability part of SMB in 2021-22 and 2022-23, and all of Epiphany term in 2023-24. I'll be teaching it again in 2025-26.

# Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion

I am a member of the Department’s Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion committee. As a PhD student, I helped to launch the Maths First-Generation Scholars Network, which connects students and staff who are the first in their families to attend university. Alongside Katie Gittins and Denis Pattinson, I’m once again helping to coordinate the network. With the support of the EDI committee, I also started a project which provides free sanitary products to all students and staff in the Mathematical and Computer Sciences departments.

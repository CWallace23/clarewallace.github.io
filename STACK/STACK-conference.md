title: "STACK Conference 2025"

I am part of the team responsible for organising the [2025 STACK conference](https://sites.google.com/view/stack2025/home). I designed our fancy logo:

and I also gave one of the plenary talks, based on the final-year projects using STACK that I co-supervised with Sam Fearn.

This page is really just a placeholder until I add more information. There's a nice writeup on the [University website](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/mathematical-sciences/news/department-of-mathematical-sciences-hosted-international-stack-conference-2025/).

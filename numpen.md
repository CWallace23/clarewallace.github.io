I'm one of the founders of the <a href="https://www.numpen.net/">Northern Universities Maths Pedagogy Network</a>. 

We organise (semi-)regular events to help connect education-focused people in Maths departments around the North of the UK. 

We also have a Slack channel to keep the conversation going between events - email me for the link!

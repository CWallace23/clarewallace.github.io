All incoming  Maths students at Durham have access to a summer workbook and diagnostic test. In Summer of 2023, I transferred both to the STACK system. We're still working on it and I'd like to do more. 

I talked about how that went at the SOTL (Scholarship of Teaching and Learning) Forum in December 2023.

title: "Skittles"

Over the last year or so, I’ve been very preoccupied with this claim on the back of all Skittles packets:

Investigating whether it’s possible that this is true makes for a very nice, interactive, hour-long session for Sixth Formers (it’s particularly good for Open Days).

We use some combinatorics to work out how many different packets there are, some probability to think about the likelihood of finding a matching pair of packets, and then some statistics to test our hypotheses…

Over the last two years, I’ve accumulated quite a lot of data about how many Skittles of each colour are in a packet, and you can use it too; it’s all here.
